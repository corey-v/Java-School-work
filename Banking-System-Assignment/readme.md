# Basic Banking System 
This school assignment involved creating a basic banking system. The only code provided is the InputReader class everything else is my code.

The ATM class takes input via a Scanner and uses that to verify a user's sign in and then perform transactions via the Bank.

The Bank Class has one HashMap variable which stores references to each Bank Customer.

The BankCustomer class is a data class which maintains the customer's account information.
