# Working with inheritance and substitution

All code is my own.

This lab involved designing my own hierarchy from a description of several classes. 

Person: The main class that has all shared attributes from Student and Instructor grouped together. Student and Instructor inherit from this class.

Student: Extends Person. Has a hashmap of <String, Double> that store's the student's courses.

Instructor: Extends Person. Has an int for the instructor's hourly wage.

Database: Has an ArrayList of type Person. Takes both Students and Instructors.
