# Purpose of Lab
The purpose of this lab is to refactor a poorly-designed project so as to increase cohesion and decrease coupling.

The only two classes to be altered are the <b>Game</b> and <b>Room</b> class. The goal is to eliminate code duplication and refactoring it to be more reusable by supporting any number of different rooms instead of being limited to the four it currently supports.
